# Auto-Scheduler

Final Uni project

Full-stack application with .Net Web API backend, Vue.js with TS frontend, MSSQL Database.
Allows users to automatically generate timesheets for large groups in certain halls with certain presenters for a a set number of activites. Different resources, related to the schedules can be managed, such as halls, presenters, activity templates, group definitions. The timesheet generation takes into account halls and presenters' busy hours and the structure of the groups, included in it (one can be a child, i.e. part of another), as well as the set requirements for the activities such as duration, type of hall, group that it's made for, etc.
